&lt;div>;如果你想经营一家不需要全职经理的公司，你就必须先于人管理流程。报告经理不断跟进他们的报告、进行每日站立会议、每周 1-1 和所有其他形式的密集监督的传统范式需要（大部分）被异步的、自我管理的范式所取代&lt;br>;&lt;br>;让我们在 &lt;a href=&quot;https://37signals.com/&quot;>;37signals&lt;/a>; 看看该原则在实践中发挥作用的五种方式。 &lt;br>;&lt;br>;首先，我们用一组 &lt;a href=&quot;https://basecamp.com/features/automatic-check-ins&quot;>;Basecamp 中的自动问题取代了常用的每日站立会议&lt;/a>;。在星期一早上，我们问每个人“你这周打算做什么？”，在每天结束时，我们问“你今天做了什么？”。这两个反复出现的问题提供了让每个人——不仅是经理，还有其他团队的同事和同事——了解某人正在做什么的关键过程。&lt;br>;&lt;br>;其次，我们限制绝大多数的产品管理规划决策每隔一个月才会发生一次。我们的&lt;a href=&quot;https://basecamp.com/shapeup&quot;>;Shape Up&lt;/a>; 方法让我们在&lt;a href=&quot;https://basecamp.com/shapeup/0.3-chapter-01#six -week-cycles&quot;>;6 周周期&lt;/a>;，&lt;a href=&quot;https://basecamp.com/shapeup/2.2-chapter-08#cool-down&quot;>;2 周冷却时间&lt;/一个>;。这给我们留下了每年大约六个周期。六次我们决定“我们接下来应该做什么”。六次回顾在前一个周期中完成的工作。&lt;br>;&lt;br>;第三，我们使用&lt;a href=&quot;https://basecamp.com/features/hill-charts&quot;>;Basecamp 中的山图&lt;/ a>; 给出“我们在这个项目中的位置”的鸟瞰图；给任何想知道的人。这与日常问题一起，取代了绝大多数“这会很快发货吗？”的问题。经理在工作进行时可能倾向于提出的问题。&lt;br>;&lt;br>;第四，我们依靠 6 周周期的有限自主权来限制项目永远拖延的风险。每个从事一项功能工作的人都知道他们必须找到一种方法来&lt;a href=&quot;https://basecamp.com/shapeup/3.5-chapter-14#scope-hammering&quot;>;锤击范围&lt;/a>;足以发布在该最大预算范围内（通常预算更短！）。这使他们能够在不需要经理的情况下做出必要的权衡。&lt;br>;&lt;br>;第五，我们将对新员工工作的审查委托给指导同事。这分配了管理的一项关键职能，确保整个团队的工作质量，并通过仅让高级员工担任单个学员的导师来保持合理。与此同时，我们确保导师认真承担这一责任，让他们为他们所指导的人交付的工作质量负责。&lt;br>;&lt;br>;这些流程帮助我们大大减少了管理工作量37signals 需要监督。他们是支撑&lt;a href=&quot;https://37signals.com/podcast/hire-managers-of-one/&quot;>;Manager of One&lt;/a>;理想的支柱。&lt;br>;&lt; br>;这种方法使我们目前在所有编程、运营和设计团队中只有一名全职工程经理。其他每一位经理都是&lt;a href=&quot;https://m.signalvnoise.com/moonlighting-managers-aint-got-no-time-for-bullshit/&quot;>;兼职经理&lt;/a>;，他们也在他们的工作上取得进展自己的个人工作。&lt;br>;&lt;br>;在执行级别也是如此。杰森和我都是兼职经理。我们将大部分时间用于通过直接从事设计、编程、文案撰写或其他方面的工作来推动产品向前发展。作为首席运营官，伊莱恩确保所有其他运营顺利进行。&lt;br>;&lt;br>;这并不是说管理人员不好。有很多很好的理由可以说明为什么要直接与人们联系，帮助指导他们的职业生涯，并在他们偏离轨道时提供重定向反馈。 &lt;br>;&lt;br>;但要说的是，这些管理职能可以与传统范式下经理每周要花几个星期的许多其他日常监督工作分开。如果这样做，您就可以少得多的全职经理，让个人贡献者作为一个人的经理蓬勃发展，因为他们在共同的目标下追求精通和自主。&lt;br>;&lt;br>;正确的流程和其余的将随之而来。&lt;/div>;

&lt;div>;编程中运行时间最长的分歧之一是静态类型与动态类型的分歧。在我的整个职业生涯中，我从双方那里听到了一百万次争论，但很少有人能说服任何人。伪装成理性的合理化在信仰问题上很少这样做。骑手将永远证明大象的方式是正确的。&lt;br>;&lt;br>;这并不是说没有人改变了阵营。事实上，这些人通常会喊出最响亮的合理化理由。通常具有长期杂食动物突然转变为素食主义者或幸运地乘坐加密货币的传统银行家的魅力。信念越短，火焰越亮。&lt;br>;&lt;br>;就我个人而言，我是一个毫不掩饰的充满活力的打字者。这就是我如此热爱 Ruby 的原因。它充分利用动态类型来允许产生如此优美代码的诗意语法。对我来说，带有显式静态类型的 Ruby 就像沙拉加一勺冰淇淋。他们只是不在一起。&lt;br>;&lt;br>;我还要承认，我过去曾拥护动态打字的福音派立场。到了遭受单一真命题痛苦的地步。将对动态类型缺乏热情视为缺乏教育、经验甚至能力的反映。&lt;br>;&lt;br>;哦，多么愚蠢。&lt;br>;&lt;br>;就像试图说服一个内向的人他们真的喜欢聚会，如果他们放松一点的话。 &lt;em>;实际上&lt;/em>;在拥挤的房间里真的很有趣，连续几个小时，大声交流，因为那种 VIBE 怎么样！&lt;br>;&lt;br>;这些天，我开始欣赏这种壮丽的多样性。如果我们都局限于同一个范式，那么编程将是一项可怕的工作。人性千差万别，无法接受对其创造力的这种限制。&lt;br>;&lt;br>;您能想象如果所有视觉艺术都必须以立体主义风格呈现吗？还是现实主义？或者所有的小说都是海明威风格的短篇小说？这一切很快就会变得多么无聊！&lt;br>;&lt;br>;它会毁掉编程的魔力。这种艺术与工程的独特融合。&lt;br>;&lt;br>;但我花了一段时间才得出这些结论。我是一个正在恢复的解决方案主义者。因此，当我看到人们不相信任何人、任何地方都可能会喜欢 JavaScript 而不是 TypeScript 时，我会微笑，而且我记得在镜子中认出他们的热情的日子。&lt;br>;&lt;br>;这还不是全部编程方法的问题归结为相同但不同的心态。这种相对主义是有局限性的。但是动态类型与静态类型在其范围内是确定的。函数式编程与面向对象编程也是如此。几十年来，这两个轴上的两极都证明可以提供出色的软件（也有糟糕的东西！）。&lt;br>;&lt;br>;现在，人们很幸运能够从任何一端同样出色地表达自己。不过，这种灵巧的本性似乎很少见，&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1655076668787097607&quot;>;任何一方都如此频繁地表达完全的怀疑&lt;/a>;，以至于另一方可能持有合理的位置。&lt;br>;&lt;br>;我不是灵巧的。我不喜欢静态打字，而且物体让我的脑海充满活力。但我开始欣赏这样一个事实，即其他人使用函数式编程约束和明确拼写的类型，与我一样强烈地阐明他们的创造力。&lt;br>;&lt;br>;只要我永远不必弄脏我的 Ruby键入提示或用 TypeScript 编写所有前端代码，我可以与那些喜欢 Go 或不能忍受 JavaScript 的人愉快地共存。差异万岁！&lt;/div>;

&lt;div>;如果我陷入创意低谷，通常只有一个补救办法：继续前进。也就是说，接受低迷，但继续盯着电脑，等待它过去。在盯着电脑看的同时，在更有灵感的时候，还有一些琐碎和管理任务可以搁置一旁。检查事情，回到人们身边，并阅读大量的互联网。但这仍然是一个创意死区。&lt;br>;&lt;br>;然后，当我对仆人、管理人员和互联网感到厌倦时，诅咒通常就会被打破。那是创造力回归的时刻。当所有的杂念都被他们的低沉耗尽。没有比打开编辑器和代码更好的事情了。 &lt;br>;&lt;br>;我通常会在多巴胺高潮后遇到这些低迷，就像一个特别激烈的创作时期所推动的那样。从热切地致力于一个想法，看到它绽放，然后感受夏天的释放。仿佛秋天必须跟随花开。就好像创意果汁真的是果汁一样，你可以喝一口。 &lt;br>;&lt;br>;但也可能在脱离常规太久后发生。可能连续几周充满会议或旅行，特别糟糕。就像头脑在再次发芽之前必须回到舒适的凹槽中一样。&lt;br>;&lt;br>;我过去对这种振荡过程更加不耐烦。过于渴望再次高歌猛进。但随着年龄的增长，我开始接受这样一个事实，即在富有成效的头脑中，它不可能是永恒的阳光。你需要让天气过去。今天灰暗潮湿的日子为明天的阳光浸透土壤。&lt;br>;&lt;br>;无论如何，抱怨下雨对你没有任何好处。不要与自然争辩。等等。不知不觉天亮了。&lt;/div>;

&lt;div>;I won&#39;t deny there may well be cases where a microservices-first architecture makes sense, but I think they&#39;re few and far in between. The vast majority of systems are much better served by starting and staying with a majestic monolith. The Prime Video case study that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7059822946831192066/&quot;>;blew up the internet&lt;/a>; yesterday is but the latest illustration.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;Maybe once you reach the scale of Netflix or Amazon, there are areas where it starts to make sense, but remember that even the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.blog/2023-04-06-building-github-with-ruby-and-rails/&quot;>;likes of GitHub&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RealGeneKim/status/1653400374378901504&quot;>;Shopify&lt;/a>; run their main applications as monoliths with millions of lines of code and have thousands of programmers collaborating on them. Do you have many more millions of lines of code or thousands of programmers working on the same code bases? If not, exercise extreme caution before even thinking about microservices.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;But that&#39;s advice for folks starting new systems today. What do you do if you already, and prematurely, went with a microservices architecture? How do you recover? Here are a few tips:&lt;br>;&lt;br>;&lt;strong>;1) Stop digging.&lt;/strong>; You can&#39;t clean up a mess before you stop making more of it. That means not introducing new microservices. It then means picking one of the existing microservices to be the epicenter that will carry new functionality instead. The gravitational pull of this new center should eventually swallow the majority of other microservices too, but the most important thing to get going is not to make matters worse.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;&lt;strong>;2) Consolidate critical, dependent paths first.&lt;/strong>; The worst form of microservice madness is when you splinter a single, coherent flow across multiple systems. Maybe this is signup, maybe this is checkout, maybe this is visiting a single piece of content. That&#39;s where microservices cause the most harm by making it cumbersome and error prone to update the entire flow. Making changes means coordinating across multiple systems, dealing with synchronization issues, and worse. So your consolation of microservices into macroservices on the way back to the monolith should start here.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;&lt;strong>;3) Leave isolated performance hotspots for last.&lt;/strong>; When microservices are done right, they often target a narrow, isolated, and usually performance-critical segment of the system, which can benefit from a rewrite in a clunkier but faster programming language. Maybe your entire web application is written in &lt;a href=&quot;https://rubyonrails.org&quot;>;Ruby on Rails&lt;/a>;, but there&#39;s this one screen that can see wild load spikes, and for some reason can&#39;t be cached, so you pull out Rust or Go or whatever to squeeze all the juice out of your CPU. Well done, you&#39;ve microserviced with honors! (Just make sure you&#39;ve actually done the benchmarking to prove the productivity regression was worth it.)&lt;br>;&lt;br>;&lt;strong>;4) Prioritize dropping the most esoteric implementations.&lt;/strong>; One of the terrible side effects of microservice madness is the tendency to embrace a million different programming languages, frameworks, and ecosystems. The siren song of microservices sing tall tales of isolation, which conjure CIO dreams of &amp;quot;best-in-breed&amp;quot;, and tickle the natural programmer tendency to experiment with new and different as much as possible. &lt;br>;&lt;br>;But the end result might well be a system comprised of 3-5-7 different programming languages, even more diverse frameworks, and a bunch of parallel dependency tracks. This is murder for conceptual comprehension, and leads to the common microservices symptom of &amp;quot;nobody understands or can work on the whole system&amp;quot;. &lt;br>;&lt;br>;Thus, you must start pruning. The vast majority of systems should have no more than two backend languages in play at any one time: A general purpose language tuned for programmer productivity that you can use 99% of the time, and a high-performance language tuned for addressing the last 1% of hotspots, should they ever appear.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;&lt;strong>;5) Learn to partition large systems with modules rather than networks.&lt;/strong>; So much of the motivation for microservices has been driven by the fallacy that if you can&#39;t figure out how to properly architect a large system using programming tools like modules and namespaces, then you can solve this problem by partitioning it with network boundaries. No, no, no.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;Making a large, resilient, performant system is hard. Trying to design one for a novel problem space on day one is impossible. Heed the timeless advice of John Gall:&lt;br>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;&lt;blockquote>;&lt;em>;A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that works. The inverse proposition also appears to be true: A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be made to work.&lt;/em>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;div>;&lt;br>;Simplicity demands that you do not start by inviting the beast of complexity – distributed systems – to the first dance. It&#39;s possible you&#39;ll one day end up with a complex, distributed systems that use microservices with justification, but that will only happen in good conscience if you started with a simple, monolithic design.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;The key tome to study for how to break down large problem spaces into beautiful domain models is Eric Evan&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215/&quot;>;Domain-Driven Design&lt;/a>;. But you should only graduate to that level of strategic, architectural aspirations after you&#39;ve mastered the basics of tactical programming through books like Kent Beck&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Smalltalk-Best-Practice-Patterns-Kent/dp/013476904X/&quot;>;Smalltalk Best Practices&lt;/a>; (if you work in object-orientated languages) and Martin Fowler&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Patterns-Enterprise-Application-Architecture-Martin/dp/0321127420/&quot;>;Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture&lt;/a>;.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;Our industry is full of bright, passionate people. Many of them eager to start an Iron Man before they&#39;ve done a 5K run. As much as I admire the gumption and self-confidence, and don&#39;t believe as a general rule in &lt;a href=&quot;https://sive.rs/kimo&quot;>;learning speed limits&lt;/a>;, I also think we&#39;ve done the lot of them a disservice by not being clearer about the dangers of microservices earlier.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;But that&#39;s the great thing about learning: You can always start! And if learning something new makes you reflect differently on the choices you made before, then you can change your approach from this day forth.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;Yes, microservices, like any pattern of programming, is a tool. Yes, &amp;quot;it depends&amp;quot; is technically correct. But we offer no guidance to those looking to design better systems by simply saying that; we need to be willing to say WHAT IT DEPENDS ON. Just saying &amp;quot;it depends&amp;quot; helps nobody, anywhere make better decisions.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;So let&#39;s be clear. Using microservices well usually depends on:&lt;br>;&lt;br>;&lt;strong>;a) Having a large, complex system that has successfully evolved from a small, simple system.&lt;/strong>;&lt;br>;&lt;br>;&lt;strong>;b) The ability to identify a part of this clearly modularized design that has strong boundaries, and no critical-flow dependencies, as a candidate for extraction.&lt;/strong>; Then only proceeding IF there are large performance gains to be had by switching implementation approach OR there are organizational benefits from placing the module with an entire team, which can&#39;t easily collaborate with the rest of the system makers.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;You might well find other justifications within your system or organization, but they should be clearly articulated, rigorously examined, and critically challenged before embarking on microservices.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;Or, you know, you can just YOLO, have fun needlessly splintering your system design into dozens of pieces, and then return to this guide when the hangover hurts enough. &lt;a href=&quot;https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-majestic-monolith/&quot;>;The majestic monolith&lt;/a>; will always be here when you&#39;re ready to enjoy its simplicity and wisdom.

This move saved them a staggering 90%(!!) on operating costs, and simplified the system too. What a win!&lt;br>;&lt;br>;But beyond celebrating their good sense, I think there&#39;s a bigger point here that applies to our entire industry. Here&#39;s the telling bit:&lt;br>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;&lt;blockquote>;&lt;em>;&amp;quot;We designed our initial solution as a distributed system using serverless components... In theory, this would allow us to scale each service component independently. However, the way we used some components caused us to hit a hard scaling limit at around 5% of the expected load.&amp;quot;&lt;/em>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;div>;&lt;br>;That really sums up so much of the microservices craze that was tearing through the tech industry for a while: IN THEORY. Now the real-world results of all this theory are finally in, and it&#39;s clear that in practice, microservices pose perhaps the biggest siren song for needlessly complicating your system. And serverless only makes it worse.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;What makes this story unique is that Amazon was the original poster child for service-oriented architectures. The far more reasonable prior to microservices. An organizational pattern for dealing with intra-company communication at crazy scale when API calls beat scheduling coordination meetings.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;SOA makes perfect sense at the scale of Amazon. No single team could ever hope to know or understand everything needed to steer such a fleet of supertankers. Making teams coordinate via published APIs was a stroke of genius.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;But, as with many good ideas, this pattern turned toxic as soon as it was adopted outside its original context, and wreaked havoc once it got pushed into the internals of single-application architectures. That&#39;s how we got microservices.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;In many ways, microservices is a zombie architecture. Another strain of an intellectual contagion that just refuses to die. It&#39;s been eating brains since the dark days of J2EE (remote server beans, anyone??) through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/1428661128/&quot;>;WS-Deathstar&lt;/a>; nonsense, and now in the form of microservices and serverless.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;But this third wave seems finally to have crested. I wrote an ode to &lt;a href=&quot;https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-majestic-monolith/&quot;>;The Majestic Monolith&lt;/a>; way back in 2016. Kelsey Hightower, one of the leading voices behind Kubernetes, &lt;a href=&quot;https://changelog.com/posts/monoliths-are-the-future&quot;>;put it beautifully in 2020&lt;/a>;:&lt;br>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;&lt;blockquote>;&lt;em>;&amp;quot;We&#39;re gonna break [the monolith] up and somehow find the engineering discipline we never had in the first place... Now you went from writing bad code to building bad infrastructure.  &lt;br>;&lt;br>;Because it drives a lot of new spend, it drives a lot of new hiring… So a lot of people get addicted to all the flourishment of money, and marketing, and it&#39;s just a lot of buzz that people are attaching their assignment to, when honestly it&#39;s not gonna necessarily solve their problem.&amp;quot;&lt;/em>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;div>;&lt;br>;Bingo. Replacing method calls and module separations with network invocations and service partitioning within a single, coherent team and application is madness in almost all cases. &lt;br>;&lt;br>;I&#39;m happy that we beat back the zombie onslaught of that terrible idea for the third time in my living memory, but we still need to stay vigilant that we&#39;ll eventually have to do it again. Some bad ideas simply refuse to die no matter how many times you kill them. All you can do is recognize when they rise from the dead once more, and keep your retorical shotgun locked and loaded.&lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</content><author><name> David Heinemeier Hansson</name><email> dhh@hey.com</email></author></entry><entry><id> tag:world.hey.com,2005:World::Post/28661</id><published> 2023-05-03T08:01:29Z</published><updated> 2023-05-03T08:01:29Z </updated><link href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/sovereign-clouds-661eb5e4" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><title> Sovereign clouds</title><content type="html"> &lt;div class=&quot;trix-content&quot;>; &lt;div>;I&#39;ve been talking about &lt;a href=&quot;https://world.hey.com/dhh/why-we-re-leaving-the-cloud-654b47e0&quot;>;our departure&lt;/a>; from renting computers via AWS to owning them in a colocated datacenter as our &amp;quot;cloud exit&amp;quot;. But I recognize this terminology can rub some people the wrong way. There&#39;s an entire generation of technologists who see themselves as &amp;quot;cloud native&amp;quot;, and alienating them just because we want to own our hardware rather than rent it doesn&#39;t help anyone. Most of the skills of these cloud natives are useful regardless of where the applications run.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;That skill overlap is actually part of why our transition out of AWS has gone &lt;a href=&quot;https://world.hey.com/dhh/the-hardware-we-need-for-our-cloud-exit-has-arrived-99d66966&quot;>;so incredibly fast&lt;/a>;. 80-90% of what you need to know to run your own hardware these days is the same as what you need to know to operate in the rental clouds. From containers to load balancers to monitoring to performance analysis, and a million other topics, the tech stack is not just similar, but literally the same.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;There are some differences, of course. Like FinOps, where you no longer have to be a forensic accountant to understand your bill or a bulldog to guard against it running wild, if you own your hardware! But then that does also entail occasionally dealing with an alert that a disk has gone bad, and asking your white-glove service at the data center to change it.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;But in the grand scheme of things, these are minor differences. It really shouldn&#39;t take long to teach someone who&#39;s proficient in the rental clouds how to run the same stack on owned hardware. (It surely must be an easier learning curve than getting up to speed with Kubernetes!)&lt;br>;&lt;br>;To address this, some have suggested the terminology of &amp;quot;private cloud&amp;quot;. I get some CIO-white-paper heebie-jeebies from that moniker, though, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s got enough of a punch for the general public to illuminate the difference. But I will admit that it&#39;s clearly more disarming to an industry that just settled into an identity of being Cloud Everything, so it got me thinking.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;Ultimately, I believe the key distinction here is not public vs private but owning vs renting. We need a counter to the &amp;quot;you will own nothing and be happy&amp;quot; pitch of the rental clouds. That sentiment is simply alien to the ethos of the internet. It ought to galvanize all fans of this distributed, permissionless wonder of the world into opposition!&lt;br>;&lt;br>;So let me propose a new term: Sovereign clouds. &lt;br>;&lt;br>;Built upon ownership and independence. An upgrade available to all rental cloud clients, as soon as their business is strong enough to carry a bit of upfront cost. An aspirational goal for those with material and fundamental computing needs to own their digital homesteads rather than rent a farm from the big tech cloud lords. A counter to the centralization of the internet, and the monopoly rents that is starting to entail.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;Puff on that!&lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</content><author><name> David Heinemeier Hansson</name><email> dhh@hey.com</email></author></entry><entry><id> tag:world.hey.com,2005:World::Post/28647</id><published> 2023-05-02T13:50:22Z</published><updated> 2023-05-02T14:48:58Z </updated><link href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/cloud-exit-pays-off-in-performance-too-4c53b697" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><title> Cloud exit pays off in performance too</title><content type="html"> &lt;div class=&quot;trix-content&quot;>; &lt;div>;Last week, we successfully pulled off our biggest &lt;a href=&quot;https://world.hey.com/dhh/why-we-re-leaving-the-cloud-654b47e0&quot;>;cloud exit&lt;/a>; yet for Basecamp Classic.

The mean request in 95ms vs 138ms. The median query time has dropped in half (which adds up when you do a lot of queries per request!). Basecamp Classic was no slouch in the cloud before, but now 95% of all requests are below that magic 300ms cut-off.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;(But take these comparisons with a pound of salt. It&#39;s not exactly a clean-room, scientific test. Just a peak at the reality of leaving a fine-tuned cloud setup for a fully-owned hardware alternative.)&lt;br>;&lt;br>;Basecamp Classic ran on EKS in AWS (that&#39;s their managed Kubernetes setup) using a mix of c5.xlarge and c5.2xlarge instances for the application itself. The databases were running on db.r4.2xlarge and db.r4.xlarge instances via RDS. Now home, we&#39;re running on Dell R7625&#39;s with dual AMD EPYC 9454 CPUs.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;This new home setup was specced with the same number of vCPUs as we ran in the cloud using KVM, so about 122 for the application and jobs. But looking at our load levels, we can probably shrink that a fair bit, and still keep these excellent performance figures.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;In fact, given that each of our new Dell R7625s have 196 vCPUs, we could actually run the entire Basecamp Classic application, including databases and Redis, on a single such machine! That&#39;s just astounding. Of course, you wouldn&#39;t actually do that for redundancy reasons, but it&#39;s a testament to the fact that &lt;a href=&quot;https://world.hey.com/dhh/hardware-is-fun-again-b819d0b4&quot;>;hardware is fun again&lt;/a>; and that we&#39;ve come full circle. Basecamp launched in 2004 on a single machine (with 1 vCPU!) and can now, in 2023, run on a single machine again.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;Each of these machines were less than $20,000. Amortize that over five years. That&#39;s $333/month for all the hardware (minus routers etc) needed to run Basecamp Classic today. And this is still a large SaaS app that&#39;s generating literally millions of dollars in revenue per year! The vast majority of SaaS businesses out there would require far less firepower to service their customers.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;Now, we didn&#39;t pin our &lt;a href=&quot;https://world.hey.com/dhh/five-values-guiding-our-cloud-exit-638add47&quot;>;cloud exit strategy&lt;/a>; on increasing performance, but it&#39;s nice to see that it did anyway. Especially since Basecamp Classic, this twenty-year old OG of our business, is still serving a large, loyal, and satisfied customer base that haven&#39;t received any new features in over a decade. But hey, speed is a feature too, so I guess you could say we just shipped one!&lt;br>;&lt;br>;Next up on the cloud exit schedule is the big one: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hey.com/&quot;>;HEY&lt;/a>;!

Becoming a person whose presence and competence benefits others. For both your sake and theirs.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;Jordan Peterson calls this the &amp;quot;meaningful burden&amp;quot; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/12-Rules-Life-Antidote-Chaos-ebook/dp/B01FPGY5T0/&quot;>;12 Rules for Life&lt;/a>;, and downright posits it as an antidote to depression. Echoing Victor Frankl&#39;s famous quote &amp;quot;he who has a why to live for can bear almost any how&amp;quot; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Mans-Search-Meaning-Viktor-Frankl-ebook/dp/B009U9S6FI/&quot;>;Man&#39;s Search for Meaning&lt;/a>;.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;There&#39;s something inherently counterintuitive about this notion that people who feel overwhelmed by life, or lost in its endless possibilities, might not need a lighter load, but a more meaningful burden instead. It reminds me of the version of burnout that stems not from overwork, but from under-purpose. Sometimes, the answer to &amp;quot;it&#39;s just all too much&amp;quot; is, weirdly, &amp;quot;can I have some more, please&amp;quot;.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;Denmark&#39;s strong culture of clubs and associations, in which 9/10 Danes belong to some form of one or the other, is an example of this. All of these clubs and associations are built primarily on volunteer efforts. People choosing to spend their evenings, weekends, or vacations on organizing and participating in cinema groups, handball leagues, trading-card circles, and a million other things. Not just because they really like films or handball or trading cards, but also because they like the responsibility that comes with being an organizer of such efforts.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;I&#39;ve spent the last twenty-plus years finding such purpose in open-source development. Becoming a person whose presence and competence benefits others through the sharing of free software and ideas. And I&#39;ve seen countless others do it too. But I&#39;ve also seen people become upset about this concept that the responsibility is the reward in itself when it comes to open source software. That there&#39;s something inherently unfair or exploitive about people choosing to spend their free time, without recompense, on advancing projects that might commercially benefit others. The whole &amp;quot;unpair labor&amp;quot; theory of contributions.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;But the more I think of it, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://world.hey.com/dhh/i-won-t-let-you-pay-me-for-my-open-source-d7cf4568&quot;>;I&#39;ve thought about it a fair deal&lt;/a>;, the more tragic I think it would be if all the hundreds of thousands of programmers who find purpose in open source start seeing their contributions primarily as a poorly-paid second job. What a well of resentment that would fill.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;Some people are lucky to find a full serving of purpose at home or at work. But many more need to find it in a third place. A place where the responsibility is the reward. This should be encouraged and commended.&lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</content><author><name> David Heinemeier Hansson</name><email> dhh@hey.com</email></author></entry><entry><id> tag:world.hey.com,2005:World::Post/28476</id><published> 2023-04-26T09:35:35Z</published><updated> 2023-05-08T08:00:32Z </updated><link href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/getting-america-s-mojo-back-7889dec1" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><title> Getting America&#39;s mojo back</title><content type="html"> &lt;div class=&quot;trix-content&quot;>; &lt;div>;There is no end to accounts of America&#39;s current ailments.

This is not a novel situation.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;Or what about the economy. Tales of Millennials doing poorly is an entire genre, and so is the story of how inequality is crushing everyone but the one percent. And it&#39;s true that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2020/02/07/6-facts-about-economic-inequality-in-the-us/&quot;>;US has the highest income inequality of the G7 countries&lt;/a>;, and that it&#39;s growing. &lt;br>;&lt;br>;But it&#39;s also true that median incomes in the US have risen faster than comparable economies. Here&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/04/13/from-strength-to-strength&quot;>;The Economist making the comparison to the UK&lt;/a>;: &amp;quot;Britons, some of Europe&#39;s best-off inhabitants, spent 80% as much as Americans in 1990. By 2021 that was down to 69%.&amp;quot; On purely median-income terms, all boats are rising in the US, even if the biggest boats are rising faster. The Economist points to America&#39;s increasing rates of productivity to explain the progress, and that does ring true (just measure how long it takes to get a rental car in the US vs in Europe for one vivid illustration!).&lt;br>;&lt;br>;And a recent article in The Atlantic did an excellent job of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/05/millennial-generation-financial-issues-income-homeowners/673485/&quot;>;dispelling the myth that Millennials have been uniquely screwed&lt;/a>; compared to past generations. Not only are Millennial median incomes significantly above past generations in constant dollars at the same time, home ownership is basically the same (48% vs 50%), and even wealth accumulation is largely on track.&lt;br>;&lt;br>; &lt;figure class=&quot;attachment attachment--preview attachment--lightboxable attachment--png&quot;>; &lt;a download=&quot;household-income.png&quot; title=&quot;Download household-income.png&quot; data-click-proxy-target=&quot;lightbox_link_blob_1198808903&quot; href=&quot;https://world.hey.com/dhh/7889dec1/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHNLd2RIWDNSSCIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--08361b3ab86f60d3547aed763814290d95d42d5b/household-income.png?disposition=attachment&quot;>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://world.hey.com/dhh/7889dec1/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHNLd2RIWDNSSCIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--08361b3ab86f60d3547aed763814290d95d42d5b/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJY0c1bkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFLQUIya0NBQVU2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwU3pvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--946116ea0c454412635aa7309bd9472bf633014c/household-income.png&quot; alt=&quot;household-income.png&quot; srcset=&quot;https://world.hey.com/dhh/7889dec1/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHNLd2RIWDNSSCIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--08361b3ab86f60d3547aed763814290d95d42d5b/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJY0c1bkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFJQUQya0NBQW82REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwUVRvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--8c0bbbd8bfe72a73b222ec1c20265f8631973dc9/household-income.png 2x, https://world.hey.com/dhh/7889dec1/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHNLd2RIWDNSSCIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--08361b3ab86f60d3547aed763814290d95d42d5b/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJY0c1bkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFLQUZta0NBQTg2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwUERvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--d2fed6b5089e475a3013538949ec7f311ac6e345/household-income.png 3x&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/figure>;&lt;br>;&lt;br>;It&#39;s not all roses and sunshine, of course. There are important regressions, particularly for men without a college degree. (Meanwhile, Millenial women are up 20% over their Gen X peers and double up(!) over their boomer peers!). But the picture is far from this universally grim portrait of a generation lost.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;I sense the folly of all of this disproportionate gloom even more vividly now, having lived in Denmark for much of the past three years. Denmark really does have an incredible number of good fortunes going for it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.insider.com/copenhagen-overtakes-tokyo-world-safest-city-toronto-second-2021-8&quot;>;Copenhagen is the safest major city in the world&lt;/a>;, we have government-funded education and healthcare, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://sciencenordic.com/denmark-politics-society-and-culture/researcher-denmarks-world-record-level-of-trust-is-helping-us-in-the-fight-against-corona/1662939&quot;>;high trust&lt;/a>; in politicians, the media, and fellow citizens. There&#39;s a lot to love!&lt;br>;&lt;br>;And yet, I think many middle-class Americans would chafe at a trade. Plenty of Danes, especially in the larger cities, live in comparably small apartments, wash their clothes in common areas in the basement, don&#39;t own a car, and contend themselves with long waits for many forms of medical care. The average Dane pays about a third of their earnings in income taxes, too, and another quarter when they spend the money left over on purchases (VAT).&lt;br>;&lt;br>;Again, I think &lt;a href=&quot;https://world.hey.com/dhh/america-is-never-getting-to-denmark-e471ae91&quot;>;the Danish setup is working very well for the Danes&lt;/a>;. But I also think some Americans have a tendency to romanticize the Nordics. And to think all that&#39;s needed to turn the US into a similar society is just to tax some billionaires more. That&#39;s just nonsense. Not just because of the diversity and inherent individualism of American society, but also because the numbers just don&#39;t add up, and because plenty of Americans would reject the broad taxes and other material sacrifices that would come with the trade.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;There are a million other angles you could look at the reason for this American malaise. Plenty of data points that would prove your thesis that it&#39;s all going to hell in a handbasket. But if you allow yourself to zoom out a bit, look at the long historical trends, you might just find that things aren&#39;t actually as dire as the constant feed of dystopian headlines would lead you to believe.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;America is in a funk right now, there&#39;s no doubt about it. Some of that funk is rooted in real, novel, and difficult dilemmas and regressions. But plenty of it also just stems from the general &lt;em>;vibe&lt;/em>; that things are terrible because they &lt;em>;feel&lt;/em>; terrible. And that&#39;s the part that seems self-inflicted, unnecessary, and correctable.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;America needs to get its mojo back. Its self-confidence. Not the starry-eyed, see-no-evil-hear-no-evil kind, but the realistic kind. The kind that&#39;s proud of its incredibly dynamic economy, world-class innovations, agile companies, entrepreneurial spirit, melting-pot achievements, and charter of progress. &lt;br>;&lt;br>;Not only does America itself depend on that, but these little fairy-tale societies in the Nordics do too. Despite all its flaws, I don&#39;t actually want to see where the world might go if a strong America is replaced on the world scene by the current prospective alternatives.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;It took a break from being in the thick of it to realize that, yes, I am actually on Team America. Proudly so. Rooting for its success, spiritual resurgence, and prominent place in the world.&lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</content><author><name> David Heinemeier Hansson</name><email> dhh@hey.com</email></author></entry><entry><id> tag:world.hey.com,2005:World::Post/28260</id><published> 2023-04-18T12:43:10Z</published><updated> 2023-04-23T14:04:24Z </updated><link href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/how-to-continue-making-kerosene-lamps-on-the-eve-of-electricity-5a8b8e1a" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><title> How to continue making kerosene lamps on the eve of electricity</title><content type="html"> &lt;div class=&quot;trix-content&quot;>; &lt;div>;The recent and rapid advance of AI has rightfully given many in software real doubts about the future of their profession.

Forever.&amp;quot; that a certain pessimism would be perfectly reasonable.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;I&#39;ve seen, for example, at least three hype cycles of No Code movements come and go over those thirty years, and none of them ever fulfilled their grand promises. Even the two properly big transformations we&#39;ve had in that time, the internet and mobile, havn&#39;t made the kind of programming most people do today look all that different from the kind of programming done in the 90s.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;So on the one hand you&#39;d be wise to keep skepticism by your side, as the world hurls itself toward the summit of AI infatuation. And on the other, you&#39;d also do well to practice the negative visualization of a world where the hype is real. Maybe we have finally reached the beginning of the end for software development as we formerly knew it.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;The purpose of such visualization is not to descend into the catacombs of professional nihilism. That nothing we do now matters, because the coming AI overlords will relieve us of our duties in a moment anyway. But to muster the humility to accept that, yes, occasionally, if rarely, the world really does change dramatically. And there&#39;s nothing to be gained from nurturing existential fears of what you cannot change.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;I like to imagine that all of us in software development, as it looks today, are busy making beautiful kerosene lamps in all shapes and sizes. We&#39;re improving the burn efficiency. We&#39;re finding ever clearer forms of glass to let the light through. We&#39;re tinkering with a formula that&#39;s been around for a long time. But as we do, Edison and Tesla are busy inventing electricity in the other room.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;I&#39;m sure it wasn&#39;t clear at all, even to Edison and Tesla, when exactly the switch would be flipped on that final lightbulb moment. And meanwhile, the world still needed to see in the dark, so the lamps of old were still necessary. That just might be us, right now, lighting the path to the future with the ways of what could soon be the past.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;That&#39;s a beautiful mission. &lt;br>;Even if it&#39;s a one-way ticket. &lt;br>;We had to come.&lt;br>;Don&#39;t cry, baby.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;*Virgil out*&lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</content><author><name> David Heinemeier Hansson</name><email> dhh@hey.com</email></author></entry><entry><id> tag:world.hey.com,2005:World::Post/28065</id><published> 2023-04-10T14:24:32Z</published><updated> 2023-04-10T15:04:17Z </updated><link href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/we-spent-300k-on-billboards-in-boston-and-it-was-a-bust-2ae8c9dd" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><title> We spent $300K on billboards in Boston and it was a bust</title><content type="html"> &lt;div class=&quot;trix-content&quot;>; &lt;div>;Our 2023 marketing campaign for &lt;a href=&quot;https://basecamp.com/&quot;>;Basecamp&lt;/a>; kicked off on a ton of different channels at once.

This 650-attendee conference will kick off the worldwide ambitions for The Rails Foundation to host a new series of ecosystem gatherings at incredibly affordable prices (this first effort will be just €199-€299 for a ticket!). Way to make an entrance!&lt;br>;&lt;br>;This new conference will kick off at quite a momentous occasion, too: Celebrating the 20th anniversary of Ruby on Rails! I started working on the framework in the summer of 2003 as part of the development of Basecamp. By October, the framework had a shape that would be completely recognizable today, with Active Record and Action Pack in place.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;It&#39;s thus also fitting that we celebrate this anniversary on the old continent, since I wrote Rails a mere 800 km away from Amsterdam in Copenhagen, Denmark. But of course we also have our eyes set on taking Rails World to the new world in the future. It was in America that Ruby on Rails really took off, and where so many of the instrumental companies in our ecosystem reside.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;Speaking of which, it&#39;s been fantastic to see the depth of commitment and support for The Rails Foundation, Rails World, and everything else we have planned from so many of these instrumental companies. It hasn&#39;t even been five months since &lt;a href=&quot;https://cookpad.com/&quot;>;Cookpad&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.doximity.com/&quot;>;Doximity&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fleetio.com/&quot;>;Fleetio&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/&quot;>;GitHub&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.intercom.com/&quot;>;Intercom&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.procore.com/&quot;>;Procore&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.shopify.com/&quot;>;Shopify&lt;/a>;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://37signals.com/&quot;>;37signals&lt;/a>; stepped up to &lt;a href=&quot;https://rubyonrails.org/2022/11/14/the-rails-foundation&quot;>;fund the foundation with a million dollars&lt;/a>; in seed money. &lt;br>;&lt;br>;It&#39;s that treasure chest, and the commitment to an ongoing budget, that&#39;s making employing Amanda as a full-time executive director and underwriting Rails World at such an accessible price possible. Huge thanks to these founding eight companies for their involvement. This is what believing in a bright future for Ruby on Rails looks like at the corporate level.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;I&#39;m personally also ever so keen to share my enthusiasm for Rails with attendees in Amsterdam this October. It never ceases to amaze me how much momentum, excitement, and passion we&#39;ve been able to sustain for now two decades. I used to think the day would come when we&#39;d just be &amp;quot;done&amp;quot;, but I&#39;ve surrendered to the notion that Ruby on Rails can always improve on &lt;a href=&quot;https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine#integrated-systems&quot;>;it&#39;s mission to be a full-stack framework&lt;/a>;. The web continues to evolve, and Rails will continue to evolve with it.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;It&#39;s also just fun to use a major conference as the occasion to present new work again. We&#39;ve been working on a bunch of novel frameworks and libraries at 37signals recently. Some that have already premiered, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://mrsk.dev/&quot;>;MRSK&lt;/a>;, and others we haven&#39;t even talked about in public yet.

That means we&#39;re adding almost 4,000 vCPUs to our on-premise fleet! And a ridiculous 7,680 GB of RAM! And 384TB of Gen 4 NVMe storage! Serious horsepower and headroom for years to come. In addition to this, we have another ~six database servers showing up between now and this summer, and then we&#39;ll be set.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;The contrast to the origin of Basecamp is funny. We launched Basecamp on a single-core Celeron server with just 256MB of RAM back in 2004. Spinning rust at 7,200 RPM. And that was good enough to get the business from part-time to full-time in about a year.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;Almost twenty years later, we now have a long lineage of legacy applications (because we promise to keep applications customers depend on running &lt;a href=&quot;https://37signals.com/policies/until-the-end-of-the-internet/&quot;>;until the end of the internet&lt;/a>;!), some massive flagship services in &lt;a href=&quot;https://basecamp.com/&quot;>;Basecamp&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hey.com/&quot;>;HEY&lt;/a>;, and a mission to get it all running on hardware we own ourselves again.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;It&#39;s kinda wild to think that it&#39;s been less than three months since we decided to scrap Kubernetes and pursue a simpler solution for the cloud exit with &lt;a href=&quot;https://mrsk.dev/&quot;>;MRSK&lt;/a>;. And that we&#39;ve already moved half of the cloud applications that need to come home!&lt;br>;&lt;br>;Over the next month or so, we plan to bring home both Basecamp Classic (still a multi-million dollar business, even if it hasn&#39;t been updated in about 13 years – that SaaS magic!), as well as the grand prize of the cloud exit: HEY! That&#39;ll leave us with just Highrise and a small auxiliary service called Portfolio left in the cloud as we start the month of May.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;I thought we were already being optimistic when we &lt;a href=&quot;https://world.hey.com/dhh/we-stand-to-save-7m-over-five-years-from-our-cloud-exit-53996caa&quot;>;planned a total cloud exit&lt;/a>; by the end of summer, but now it seems we&#39;ll basically be done by the end of spring instead. Truly a remarkable achievement by the team working on this effort.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;The reality of our accelerated timeline has made me even more bullish on cloud exits in general. I imagined getting out of the cloud was going to be as hard as getting in. But that just hasn&#39;t proven to be the case. Though perhaps it&#39;s helped that we&#39;ve had that nuts number of &lt;a href=&quot;https://37signals.com/podcast/leaving-the-cloud-part-2/&quot;>;$38,000/week in cloud spend&lt;/a>; as a motivating carrot to get it done quickly!&lt;br>;&lt;br>;I seriously hope that other SaaS entrepreneurs looking at their daunting cloud bills are paying attention. Once you&#39;ve gone cloud, it might seem impossible to contemplate getting out again, but don&#39;t believe that for a second.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;Modern server hardware is incredible. We&#39;ve taken huge leaps forward in performance, density, and cost over the last few years. If you haven&#39;t run the numbers since cloud became the default in the past decade, you really ought to do so now. The numbers might just shock you as much as they did us.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;So the end is now clearly in sight. We&#39;ve solved all the key technical challenges we needed to address to make the cloud exit happen. We&#39;ve been running production apps on MRSK for a while now.

It breaks down the history of first how the Republican party got overrun by low-rung thinking from the mid-90s forward, then how equally low-rung thinking got the other side in the past decade or so. It&#39;s a light, humorous recap of modern American political history. I highly recommend it.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;It&#39;s central contribution is adding a second dimension to the political spectrum. What we&#39;re dealing with is not just far-left, left, center, right, far-right. That spectrum is about contesting &amp;quot;what is&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;what ought to be&amp;quot;. Our current problem is not so much disagreeing about those two central elements. All democracies will and should continue to do that. It&#39;s how that disagreements manifest themselves in political tactics.

Which is what Urban does so well in this book, sums it up. Not just concepts like idea supremacy, high-rung vs low-rung thinking, ideological golems vs intellectual genies, or the Liberal Games vs the Power games. He also sums up the feeling of having been made politically homeless, as a long-term, progressive-leaning individual, once the low-rung thinking of the woke nonsense conquered one important institution after another.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;In this effort, Urban shares a lot of his analysis with the likes of John McWhorter, whose book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Woke-Racism-Religion-Betrayed-America/dp/B096L6QWZK/ref=sr_1_1?crid=24TO78VHIA4NZ&amp;amp;keywords=Woke+Racism&amp;amp;qid=1680700890&amp;amp;sprefix=woke+racism%2Caps%2C184&amp;amp;sr=8-1&quot;>;&lt;em>;Woke Racism&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>; also came from the perspective of a progressive dismayed by what he saw his &amp;quot;own side&amp;quot; turn into. But Urban zooms further out. Trying to analyze not just a particular dysfunction, such as a woke nonsense, but all forms of nonsense that occurs once our baser instincts take over.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;So I think it might be easier for progressives sitting on the fence, not sure what to think about the woke nonsense, to consider Urban&#39;s analysis. It&#39;s less testy out the gate. It starts with an account of &amp;quot;the other side started it&amp;quot;. The mood is lighter, at least in the beginning, and the drawings are funny. So by the time you get to the serious critique, your progressive guards might just have been lowered enough to consider the claims with an open mind.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;In the end, &lt;em>;What&#39;s our problem?&lt;/em>; ends with the same prescription as &lt;em>;Woke Racism&lt;/em>;, though. We have to stand up to the ideological golems in order to rescue our political discourse. To reject the echo chambers and get back to the idea labs, as Urban puts it. Refuse to let idea supremacy cow us into submission.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;As someone who&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://world.hey.com/dhh/basecamp-s-new-etiquette-regarding-societal-politics-at-work-b44bef69&quot;>;gone through it&lt;/a>;, I can tell you that it&#39;s easier said than done. But I also believe that &lt;a href=&quot;https://world.hey.com/dhh/the-waning-days-of-dei-s-dominance-9a5b656c&quot;>;the tide indeed is turning&lt;/a>;. It&#39;s far easier to stand up to the golems today than it was a couple of years ago. At least in the realm of business. (Things still look pretty rough in academia!). That&#39;s progress.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;I think we&#39;ve seen the darkest days of this. Or maybe that&#39;s just my optimistic streak wishing that to be true. But I would love to return to the idea lab. Argue positions for the intellectual sport and societal enlightenment again.

This in contrast to trying to catch every task the moment it lands from the myriad of interruption pipes that&#39;ll drip-drip-drip your day away if you let them. Nowhere is this more evident than with email.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;I used to take such pride in inbox zero when I was still using Gmail. I&#39;d check email continuously throughout the day, and I&#39;d get back to almost everyone immediately. Whether it was urgent or not. Just so I could see that sweet zero. It felt very productive. It was not.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;Every email is a drop, and every drop ripples the surface of your mind. It&#39;s careless to let them hit without a filter. Your attention will have a hard time finding a still moment to focus like that. &lt;br>;&lt;br>;This is what being busy often feels like. Like drops pelleting your brain with tasks from a dozen sources at once. Thus leaving you entirely incapable of finding the flow that&#39;ll actually take you somewhere. So many movements, so little progress.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;Rejecting this way of working is why I usually feel very content about the progress I&#39;m able to make on the things that matter, without feeling overwhelmed or busy all the time. Because it really just isn&#39;t that busy most of the time! It&#39;s focused, sure. But not busy.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;Again, let&#39;s look at email. I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hey.com/features/reply-later/&quot;>;HEY&#39;s Focus &amp;amp; Reply feature&lt;/a>; to get back to people who don&#39;t need an urgent reply (which is almost everyone). I let the bucket fill up with 30-40-50 emails over a week or two, then I knock out replies to all of them in less than an hour. Just make that contrast. Letting your attention be disturbed 30-40-50 times over a week or two vs accepting a single interruption in the form of a focused hour. It&#39;s a monumental difference.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;I do the same with GitHub issues for the many open source projects I&#39;m involved in. They&#39;ll accumulate for weeks in the notifications box, and then I&#39;ll take the time to clear it all out at once every now and then. This is key to avoiding maintainer&#39;s fatigue. I&#39;m happy to look at your suggestion or your feedback, but I&#39;ll do it on my own schedule, thank you very much.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;Same too at work. I don&#39;t spend, say, every week reviewing our expenses. But I do like to be up to speed on where the money goes. So maybe once a month or once a quarter, I&#39;ll do a deep dive, kick off a handful of inquiries on how we ought to save on the frivolous, and then forget all about expenses until next time.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;This is an intentional and sequential way to live and work.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;Too many people delude themselves into thinking they can parallelize a million things at once, but they can&#39;t. Multitasking is a mirage. Humans run single-core CPUs. All they can do is swap context in and out, losing ever more to switching costs as they do.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;There&#39;s enough time. &lt;a href=&quot;https://world.hey.com/jason/the-difference-between-time-and-attention-bdd955eb&quot;>;Time isn&#39;t the scarce resource, attention is&lt;/a>;. Find your buckets, develop the patience to let them fill, then empty them one at a time. There&#39;s your 10x productivity hack.&lt;br>;&lt;br>; &lt;figure class=&quot;attachment attachment--preview attachment--lightboxable attachment--png&quot;>; &lt;a download=&quot;hey-focus-and-reply.png&quot; title=&quot;Download hey-focus-and-reply.png&quot; data-click-proxy-target=&quot;lightbox_link_blob_1169423717&quot; href=&quot;https://world.hey.com/dhh/38693993/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHNLd2RsL2JORiIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--313424d7063acb8935450cc1c6ff4173a4ca9e6f/hey-focus-and-reply.png?disposition=attachment&quot;>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://world.hey.com/dhh/38693993/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHNLd2RsL2JORiIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--313424d7063acb8935450cc1c6ff4173a4ca9e6f/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJY0c1bkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFLQUIya0NBQVU2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwU3pvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--946116ea0c454412635aa7309bd9472bf633014c/hey-focus-and-reply.png&quot; alt=&quot;hey-focus-and-reply.png&quot; srcset=&quot;https://world.hey.com/dhh/38693993/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHNLd2RsL2JORiIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--313424d7063acb8935450cc1c6ff4173a4ca9e6f/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJY0c1bkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFJQUQya0NBQW82REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwUVRvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--8c0bbbd8bfe72a73b222ec1c20265f8631973dc9/hey-focus-and-reply.png 2x, https://world.hey.com/dhh/38693993/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHNLd2RsL2JORiIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--313424d7063acb8935450cc1c6ff4173a4ca9e6f/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJY0c1bkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFLQUZta0NBQTg2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwUERvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--d2fed6b5089e475a3013538949ec7f311ac6e345/hey-focus-and-reply.png 3x&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</content><author><name> David Heinemeier Hansson</name><email> dhh@hey.com</email></author></entry><entry><id> tag:world.hey.com,2005:World::Post/27763</id><published> 2023-03-30T09:04:24Z</published><updated> 2023-04-23T14:03:41Z </updated><link href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/america-is-never-getting-to-denmark-e471ae91" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><title> America is never &quot;getting to Denmark&quot;</title><content type="html"> &lt;div class=&quot;trix-content&quot;>; &lt;div>;It took moving back to Denmark to realize the folly of thinking America is ever going to &lt;a href=&quot;https://newrepublic.com/article/160623/getting-denmark-reclaiming-lutheran-social-democracy&quot;>;&amp;quot;get there&amp;quot;&lt;/a>;. Whether on guns or healthcare or taxes or any other major policy position that&#39;s so fiercely contested in the US. Despite growing up in this little Nordic country, I didn&#39;t fully appreciate the tremendous, underpinning power of a homogenous culture to fasten all these planks of a socially-democratic state – until I returned after 15 years Over There. I do now.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;Denmark is a notoriously difficult country to integrate in. Not only because the language is difficult, but because the people are too! I say this with all the love and respect of a Dane that continues to marvel at what a high-trust, high-coherence society these former Vikings have managed to construct.但这是真的。 Danes are ever so graceful and kind to foreigners when they&#39;re visiting, but once the welcome of a guest is worn out, they&#39;re also incredibly demanding of the integration process.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;This is why it all works! There&#39;s an immense cultural pressure to assimilate, and comply with all the major norms and beliefs. That process is how you forge that deep national unity, which makes Danes, as a whole, happy to pay their high taxes for the common good.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;Americans usually first notice this dynamic in a few funny ways. They chuckle at why most Danes will dutifully wait at the crosswalk in the rain, at night, with nary a car around, for the little man to turn from red to green.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;It may sound silly, but it&#39;s this kind of fierce conformity that carries everything else. From a level of compliance with public health authorities during the pandemic that would shock a lot of Americans (or maybe even scare them!). To rituals like using the Danish flag to celebrate birthdays or greet family at the airport (a display of overt patriotic symbolism that would instantly be coded as politically partisan in the US!).&lt;br>;&lt;br>;Danes are on a whole very proud of being Danes. And they have ample reason to be. So it&#39;s hard to fault them their strict expectations for integration.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;Let&#39;s take that language for example. I know of immigrants here in Denmark who have lived in the country for five years or more. In total command of the vocabulary, the idioms, but still lacking that last bit on pronunciation. It&#39;s common for them to face private admonishments to &amp;quot;try a little harder to work on it&amp;quot;. In addition to the inherent alienation this country silently produces when you&#39;re not able to match the perfect pitch of those æ, å, ø characters.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;Contrast this again with America. I arrive at immigration, and the officers literally guarding entry to God&#39;s own country will have a thick, foreign accent. This is normal. Nobody bats an eye. I don&#39;t think Americans critical of their own country appreciate just what a strength that is for the ease of integration!&lt;br>;&lt;br>;Now I&#39;m of course just contrasting two countries here. Denmark shares many cultural sensibilities and preferences with other Nordic and European countries. Americans aren&#39;t exactly the only country more forgiven of a thick accent (hello Spain!). But the contrast is instructive nonetheless.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;The irony is that living in Denmark has actually made me appreciate America more! For all its navel gazing about its supposed structural racism or other irredeemable sins, it is by far and away the most welcoming, open, and integratable country I&#39;ve ever spent serious time in. The cliché of the melting pot might be trite but it&#39;s still apt.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;What I&#39;ve come to accept, though, is that this openness and integration probably only works because of the individualistic streak that defines the original America ethos. That if we&#39;re going to live in a truly multicultural, heterogeneous country together, we can&#39;t also expect the levels of trust and collectivism that makes countries like Denmark capable of working like they do.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;That&#39;s a hard trade-off! When you&#39;ve seen what benefits accrue to Danes from having a competent government that literally runs everything from the healthcare system to the mass-transit systems to the education system, you&#39;d be forgiving for wishing that could be true, with the same outcomes, in America.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;Which brings me to the notion of American Exceptionalism. I used to find that idea delusional. A self-aggrandizement typical of Americans. But in light of the comparison above, I think it actually is more true than I would have cared to admit before this latest stint in Denmark. &lt;br>;&lt;br>;Creating a nation out of so many other nationalities, and making it not just work, but thrive on so many parameters absolutely is an exceptional achievement! Not sure it&#39;s ever been replicated at this scale in the history of the world. Over three hundred million people living in relative(!!) harmony, and besting the rest of the world in discipline after discipline. That is something special!&lt;br>;&lt;br>;Don&#39;t construe any of the above as apologetics for the myriad of deep problems facing America. But do consider, as an American, to what extent you might have soaked yourself in so much pointless envy about &amp;quot;what every other country in the world can do!&amp;quot; that you&#39;ve drowned the ability to appreciate the marvel of your own grand, underlying experiment.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;I&#39;ve seen it both ways now. As an immigrant to America and married to an immigrant to Denmark. I can fully appreciate why there are still legions of people around the world who dream of making it to America. That however tattered the American dream might be, the promise of being able to integrate – truly and fully – is still there. And it&#39;s worth much more than America&#39;s critics – internally, externally, and including yours truly – usually give it credit for.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;So. Despite it all, having consumed a never-ending, dreadful stream of dreary news about America for at least a decade now, I&#39;m strangely more optimistic than I&#39;ve ever been. Sure, the empire might still come tumbling down in tumultuous ways, but I&#39;m not going to count America out just yet. And regardless of what may or may not actually happen, I can at least personally change my perspective from being so incessantly negative about its prospect to focusing on its true and inherent exceptionalism.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;So that&#39;s what I now choose. I choose to cheer for America. In all its contradictions, despite all its flaws. I no longer yearn for it to just WAKE UP, and become like Denmark. Let America be America. The best, most beautiful version of America. But America.&lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</content><author><name> David Heinemeier Hansson</name><email> dhh@hey.com</email></author></entry><entry><id> tag:world.hey.com,2005:World::Post/27690</id><published> 2023-03-28T09:57:30Z</published><updated> 2023-03-28T09:57:30Z </updated><link href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/why-is-paid-social-media-a-bad-idea-623a9c76" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><title> Why is paid social media a bad idea?</title><content type="html"> &lt;div class=&quot;trix-content&quot;>; &lt;div>;It&#39;ll soon &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1640502698549075972&quot;>;cost $7/month to fully participate&lt;/a>; on Twitter. Musk has announced they&#39;ll start reserving presence in the For You tab solely for paying customers from April 15th, limit participation in polls to just those customers, and soon also give preferential showing in replies as well. Legacy blue-checks will not be spared, and will in fact lose their old privileges. The price is the same for all. Bold!&lt;br>;&lt;br>;All of the usual characters from the Musk Sucks Show are up in arms about this, of course. Something about how charging money for a service is a transgression against Musk&#39;s allegiance to free speech, I think? Hard to keep straight all the rationalization on why everything the man does is Literally The Worst Thing Ever.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;(This is the part where it&#39;s customary to insert a caveat that &lt;a href=&quot;https://world.hey.com/dhh/throw-twitter-into-the-fire-of-mount-doom-67685e95&quot;>;I Also Don&#39;t Think Everything Musk Does Is Great&lt;/a>;, but I&#39;m not going to do that, because it&#39;s fucking stupid. I don&#39;t think everything ANYONE does is great. Not my good friends, not my coworkers, NOT MYSELF. This preemptive distancing from controversial figures when they do something you actually agree with is just so performative and pathetic.)&lt;br>;&lt;br>;As previously declared, &lt;a href=&quot;https://world.hey.com/dhh/heads-we-win-tails-he-loses-16ba4116&quot;>;I don&#39;t really have a stake either way&lt;/a>;. I think there&#39;s a good argument that the world is better off if Musk truly does run Twitter into the ground! But I think it&#39;s also worth acknowledging that he &lt;em>;hasn&#39;t&lt;/em>; run Twitter into the ground, at least not yet. Despite &lt;a href=&quot;https://world.hey.com/dhh/when-prophecy-fails-65c0c34f&quot;>;the endless proclamations that the end was near&lt;/a>; following the &lt;a href=&quot;https://world.hey.com/dhh/need-it-take-7-500-people-to-run-twitter-a8cb36a6&quot;>;dramatically decreased headcount at the company&lt;/a>; last year.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;Further, I also absolutely commend the man for taking big, bold risks when it&#39;s primarily his own money on the line! And this is exactly one of those fascinating bets that I&#39;ve long wished for someone to take.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;The bet is this: Can you fund a social network with user payments? In contrast to the current established wisdom that only targeted ads will do it. We don&#39;t know! Nobody has ever tried to do it at this scale. All the attempts have usually been baked in from the beginning, thus posing a real challenge to reaching critical mass. But Musk is now going to try the experiment on a network that already has critical mass. THAT&#39;S INTERESTING!&lt;br>;&lt;br>;You&#39;d think that such an experiment would have lots of backers. Especially amongst those who&#39;ve been skeptical about what targeted ads have done to the internet in the past decade-plus. And certainly amongst those worried about &amp;quot;misinformation&amp;quot; from &amp;quot;foreign actors&amp;quot; (or whatever de jeur jargon is used to whine about adverse political outcomes). Because these concerns all jive with Musk&#39;s changes.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;I for one am a fan of any experiment that might shine light on a path out of the ad infestation that&#39;s currently possessing the internet. And I&#39;m also a fan of business model experimentation in general. Triply so when they&#39;re happening in free and competitive markets.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;That&#39;s what&#39;s so fascinating about Twitter right now. Musk gave his most ardent opponents the perfect motivation to seed and cultivate alternatives. And we&#39;ve gotten those! Mastodon has seen tremendous growth, even if it&#39;s still a tiny dot in comparison to Twitter. &lt;br>;&lt;br>;Isn&#39;t this a good thing? Isn&#39;t that the market working as it should? People voting with their feet, if they don&#39;t like the offering from the first fellow?&lt;br>;&lt;br>;I think it is. So I&#39;m happily voting with my seven dollars to see where this experiment goes.

Several of the giants are already on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-parent-meta-lay-off-10000-employees-second-round-job-cuts-2023-03-14/&quot;>;their second rounds&lt;/a>;, and few would probably bet against a third after those. But as hard as it is on an individual level – and it&#39;s always hard! – there&#39;s a silver lining for the economy as a whole: Releasing captive talent.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;See, the big tech companies gobbled up so much talent at such high salaries during the pandemic that it scarcely left any for the rest of the economy. So many companies outside of big tech were priced out of the competition for key tech hires. That just can&#39;t be good for the economy in the long run. We need smart people focused on other problems beyond figuring out how to make people click more ads.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;But while the mammoth cuts at Facebook, Amazon, and elsewhere are dominating the headlines, there are also &lt;a href=&quot;https://layoffs.fyi&quot;>;cuts happening at smaller tech companies&lt;/a>;, and I&#39;m far less convinced those have a silver lining. &lt;br>;&lt;br>;Sure, it&#39;s possible that some of these companies got out over their skis, just like the giants, and hired a bunch of people they not only didn&#39;t need, but who ended up &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.fb.com/news/2023/03/mark-zuckerberg-meta-year-of-efficiency/&quot;>;slowing down progress&lt;/a>; rather than speeding it up. If so, pulling back makes sense.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;But it&#39;s also possible that these companies are simply having to layoff people because the market for their technology is contracting, and because investors are no longer willing to extend the unprofitable runways. That is, they&#39;re firing people to cut costs, such that they won&#39;t go out of business. That&#39;s prudent, but people aren&#39;t the only cost.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;At the majority of tech companies I&#39;ve talked to, there are basically two big line items: staff and cloud. Staff is usually the biggest, but it&#39;s shocking how large the cloud bills can be as well. Or, rather, it&#39;s not shocking at all to anyone who&#39;ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.37signals.com/our-cloud-spend-in-2022/&quot;>;actually run the numbers&lt;/a>;, so perhaps a better word is &amp;quot;grotesque&amp;quot;.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;I know I&#39;m probably sounding a bit like a broken record on this cloud business, but it just frustrates me to no end to see tech companies trying to cut costs by firing folks rather than reigning in their cloud spend. And the best way to do that, especially for mid-tier software companies and above, is to actually &lt;a href=&quot;https://world.hey.com/dhh/why-we-re-leaving-the-cloud-654b47e0&quot;>;leave the cloud&lt;/a>; either in part or in total.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;So I urge any of the founders and executives looking at their budgets right now wondering where to trim the fat to focus on the cloud spend first. Maybe you can get a long way by just optimizing what you have (there&#39;s an entire cottage industry springing up to help with that!), but maybe you&#39;re also overestimating how difficult it would be to buy your own hardware and exit the cloud.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;We&#39;re about &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.37signals.com/bringing-our-apps-back-home/&quot;>;half way through our cloud exit&lt;/a>;. We only really started in earnest in January. And we&#39;re moving out apps from across the legacy spectrum, not just state-of-the-art modern stuff. It&#39;s been way easier and way faster than I had dared hope for. We&#39;re far ahead of schedule on the exit, and the big savings are in clear sight.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;If we can do it this quickly, you owe it to yourself to at least run the numbers, and look at your options, if you run a business. And you certainly owe it to your employees before you start printing those pink slips.&lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</content><author><name> David Heinemeier Hansson</name><email> dhh@hey.com</email></author></entry><entry><id> tag:world.hey.com,2005:World::Post/27502</id><published> 2023-03-22T10:11:35Z</published><updated> 2023-03-22T10:12:08Z </updated><link href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/angry-customers-are-a-gift-1949c52b" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><title> Angry customers are a gift</title><content type="html"> &lt;div class=&quot;trix-content&quot;>; &lt;div>;The majority of customers will never tell you why they stop buying on their own. In fact, even if pressed, most will just smile, nod, and give you some face-saving reason for how “now is just not the right time” or “we are just going in a different direction”. Because that&#39;s what avoids conflict.&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;Thus, the only time you&#39;re truly allowed a free peek at the naked truth of why your product or service didn&#39;t fit, is when the customer is really upset. That&#39;s when they might air out their frustration.&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;This is a test. &lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;You can either protect your ego from the sharp words of a frustrated customer by dismissing the feedback entirely OR you can be smart enough to filter out the emotion while retaining the crucial information that&#39;ll improve your offering. Every loud, angry customer represents at least a dozen silent ones you lost to the same issues.&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;But it&#39;s hard! We bond with our creations and our companies because that&#39;s the human thing to do if you like your work. So those sharp words can and often do hurt your feelings. It&#39;s only natural to want to parry and riposte.  &lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;Before you do, though, &lt;a href=&quot;https://world.hey.com/jason/no-big-deal-or-the-end-of-the-world-0b0d8619&quot;>;remember the coin&lt;/a>;. If the customer takes the side that says “this is the end of the world”, you have to train yourself not to instinctively reach for “it&#39;s no big deal / you&#39;re overreacting / everyone else is fine with it”. If you do, you&#39;ll gain nothing, and you&#39;ll learn nothing.&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;So embrace the conflict of an angry customer as a rare gift of feedback. Remove your ego from the response. Extract the maximum amount of information to feed back into the offering.&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;That&#39;s how you win.

They were smart, funny... and entirely out of sync with our budget. So we ended up letting them go, hiring a new head of marketing, and doing it all ourselves.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;The problem was that our entire marketing budget for 2023 amounted to a &amp;quot;mere&amp;quot; five million dollars. That&#39;s a huge multiple of everything we&#39;ve ever spent before on marketing in the entire 24-year history of the company, but a pittance when you work with a top-tier agency full of people who used to do campaigns for the like of Apple or Nike.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;Of course this is all on us. While the agency knew what our budget was going in, we should have known that working with people who&#39;d done work with the biggest, richest corporations in the world wouldn&#39;t adapt well to our comparably modest constraints. But it wasn&#39;t until we saw the proposal for the first video commercial that it really sunk in. The agency wanted to spend one million dollars on a thirty-second spot, which, while funny and clever, involved renting an actual wind tunnel for a couple of days. You know, those facilities used by Formula 1 teams and aerodynamicists.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;A rule of thumb for marketing, I believe it&#39;s something like you should spend 4-5 times as much on placement as production, so if we spent one million dollars on shooting the commercial, we&#39;d literally have to spend the rest of the budget on running just that one spot. That didn&#39;t seem smart.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;Enter Glenn, our new head of marketing, and Chad, our visual storyteller. Together they came up with a new idea for a different brand commercial, did everything from storyboarding to location scouting to shooting to editing themselves, and in just a few weeks produced &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPmhvY0GCMQ&quot;>;our amazingly well-received first commercial&lt;/a>; for a total all-in budget of $37,000.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;That&#39;s more like us. No, it didn&#39;t have a freaking wind tunnel, but it was just as funny of a concept, even more on point for fit with the marketing message, and the final result looks every bit as ace to my eyes as anything you&#39;d see produced at 10-20x the budget.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlGlrFUm8zA&quot;>;That&#39;s the 37signals way&lt;/a>;. &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</content><author><name> David Heinemeier Hansson</name><email> dhh@hey.com</email></author></entry><entry><id> tag:world.hey.com,2005:World::Post/27104</id><published> 2023-03-08T12:24:21Z</published><updated> 2023-03-08T12:24:21Z </updated><link href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/actions-beat-arguments-2aa1da34" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><title> Actions beat arguments</title><content type="html"> &lt;div class=&quot;trix-content&quot;>; &lt;div>;You can&#39;t convince someone invested in their convictions to the contrary by arguments alone. Only actions can pry open a locked mind, and most minds remain locked most of the time. So if you wish to be persuasive, you ought to spend less time arguing and more time doing.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;This is as it should be. Talk is cheap, and others are right to keep their considered positions from being for sale at a discount. Everyone should be open to change their mind, of course, but they should also keep the bar high or they&#39;ll drift about constantly and randomly.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;There are a thousand plausible arguments available for every possible side of any issue, but rarely more than a few that can be substantiated by reality, once put to the test. This is why we listen more to those who do than those who merely opine. Both might be wrong, but odds favor the lessons derived from contact with the real world over those kept safe from falsification.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;Credibility is thus the consequence of successful actions. The social payoff for taking a risk and seeing it through. This again is as it should be. There&#39;s an endless supply of people willing to stake nothing on their convictions in the realm of arguments, but only a few ready to risk the effort of being wrong by actually following through.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;This is what skin in the game is all about.

So much time is spent coordinating the work anyway. Who cares if the stack you&#39;re using takes twice the number of people to ship meaningful updates? You can just hire four times as many heads!&lt;br>;&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatekeeperhq.com/blog/clm-and-the-vc-backed-contract-time-bomb&quot;>;Those days seem to be over&lt;/a>;, at least for most SaaS startups. Entrepreneurs everywhere are suddenly having to count each hire as a cost rather than a trophy. Getting to profitability is no longer a distant, post-IPO nice-to-have, but a short-term necessity for survival. But how to do that without cutting off the legs of the product team? By using better tools and techniques, that&#39;s how.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;I&#39;ve been talking to a lot of SaaS entrepreneurs lately. Here are the three pieces of advice that I&#39;ve given them all:&lt;br>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;strong>;1: Unless market conditions demand otherwise, delay native app development for as long as possible. &lt;br>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;It&#39;s amazing what you can do with the mobile web today. We&#39;re even getting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/16/ios-16-4-web-push-notifications/&quot;>;native notifications on iOS shortly&lt;/a>;! But it&#39;s not perfect. We wouldn&#39;t have a chance to compete in, say, personal email with HEY without &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hey-email/id1506603805&quot;>;a killer native app&lt;/a>;. But some B2B operation that&#39;s mainly used by folks sitting in front of computers at their desk? Delay the native aspirations.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;The fact is that developing great native applications is just much harder, much slower, and much more expensive than developing for the web. Your rate of experimentation will drop, and you&#39;ll find your progress gummed up by app review frustrations too.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;strong>;2: Hire full-stack developers, and don&#39;t let them split the frontend and backend into separate jurisdictions.&lt;br>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;The same person has to be capable of taking an idea to production entirely on their own. If they can&#39;t, your setup is too complicated, and you need to simplify.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;This often comes up with teams that have ended up in React land or similar. Now there&#39;s React, then maybe GraphQL, with separate setups, build tools, and yikes. This one isn&#39;t a quick fix, and some times it just can&#39;t be fixed, but you can rescue something from the situation by at least having single full-stack developers in charge of everything.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;strong>;3: Hire designers who work natively with the web.&lt;br>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;If your designers are stuck in Figma or Photoshop, and are unable to turn drawings into HTML and CSS, they&#39;re going to be a major drag on your productivity. Designers need to know the materials they&#39;re working with, and capable of molding them independently.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;They also need to be the ones driving the decisions around &lt;a href=&quot;https://basecamp.com/shapeup/1.1-chapter-02&quot;>;how the pitch is turning into the working feature&lt;/a>;. They can&#39;t do that if they have to operate solely through the hands of others with nearly the same efficiency as when they&#39;re independently capable.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;We&#39;ve been running on these principles since inception at &lt;a href=&quot;https://37signals.com/&quot;>;37signals&lt;/a>;. That&#39;s how we&#39;ve built everything from &lt;a href=&quot;https://basecamp.com/&quot;>;Basecamp&lt;/a>; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hey.com/&quot;>;HEY&lt;/a>;. We have tiny product teams – almost every feature you see in either product was built for the web with just 1 programmer + 1 designer – and they work on with a full stack consisting of &lt;a href=&quot;https://rubyonrails.org/&quot;>;Ruby on Rails&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://hotwired.dev/&quot;>;Hotwire&lt;/a>;. &lt;br>;&lt;br>;It almost feels like we&#39;re cheating when I talk to other shops and hear about how big the teams need to be in order to ship. How much specialization has crept into the process. So many hats, so many people, so many tools. But during the go-go days, it just didn&#39;t matter.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;But these ain&#39;t the go-go days no more. If you&#39;re a SaaS entrepreneur, now is a good time to do a service check on your product team productivity. What would it do for your prospects if you could ship more, and faster, with fewer folks? Have you just followed trends blindly because that&#39;s what worked for Facebook or Google?&lt;br>;&lt;br>;It&#39;s easier to turn the ship around before you&#39;re in the middle of the storm. Right now it&#39;s just raining. But odds are worse is ahead.&lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</content><author><name> David Heinemeier Hansson</name><email> dhh@hey.com</email></author></entry><entry><id> tag:world.hey.com,2005:World::Post/26871</id><published> 2023-03-01T09:03:30Z</published><updated> 2023-03-01T09:03:30Z </updated><link href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/the-simplest-thing-that-could-possibly-work-8f0d8b43" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><title> The simplest thing that could possibly work</title><content type="html"> &lt;div class=&quot;trix-content&quot;>; &lt;div>;I&#39;m a programming child of the agile software movement. Just as I was starting out, Kent Beck published &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Programming-Explained-Embrace-Change-ebook/dp/B00N1ZN6C0/&quot;>;Extreme Programming Explained&lt;/a>; in 2000. It was a revelation. I had just enough exposure to Big Upfront Design and waterfall methodologies to appreciate what a monumental shift this was. Beck&#39;s methodology x-rayed the ills of the traditional approach, and made the terminal diagnosis crystal clear.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;But what really attracted me to Beck&#39;s vision of software development was the irreverent insistence on practicality. There was plenty of vision, plenty of principles, but they all lead to running code. In the battle for software development&#39;s soul, Beck was formulating the war cry for a rebel army tired of going in circles from commands up high.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;XP was of course just one expression of a larger set of ideals. Other prominent thinkers were onto the same paradigm shift, and in 2001 many of them got together to publish &lt;a href=&quot;https://agilemanifesto.org&quot;>;The Agile Manifesto&lt;/a>;. Including several personal programming heroes of mine, like Ward Cunningham, Martin Fowler, and Dave Thomas. The points that still make my brain sparkle are &amp;quot;individuals over processes&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;working software over comprehensive documentation&amp;quot;. Take me to church!&lt;br>;&lt;br>;Beck took these lofty ideals, though, and again made them more practical still. Two expressions of that was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artima.com/articles/the-simplest-thing-that-could-possibly-work&quot;>;the simplest thing that could possibly work&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.c2.com/?YouArentGonnaNeedIt&quot;>;you aren&#39;t gonna need it&lt;/a>;. To this day, these are the mottos that move all my programming work forward. It&#39;s so easy to get lost in sentiments like &amp;quot;but wouldn&#39;t it be nice if...&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;we&#39;ll probably also need...&amp;quot;. You need pithy mental antidotes at the ready to provide a counter.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;What I&#39;ve later also come to appreciate is how well these mottos pair with a cultivated strain of ignorance, if you want to tackle existing problems from first principles. It took being an outsider to J2EE to pursue &lt;a href=&quot;https://rubyonrails.org/&quot;>;Ruby on Rails&lt;/a>;. And being an outsider to JavaScript to chase &lt;a href=&quot;https://hotwired.dev&quot;>;Hotwire&lt;/a>;. And now, again, being an outsider to Kubernetes to sail with &lt;a href=&quot;https://mrsk.dev&quot;>;MRSK&lt;/a>;. It&#39;s easier to break the paradigms if you&#39;re not enmeshed in them on the daily.&lt;br>;&lt;br>;But even when you&#39;re not busting paradigms, these mottos are paramount. It&#39;s how you go from nothing to working software in days, not weeks or months. By cutting straight to the chase for &lt;a href=&quot;https://basecamp.com/gettingreal/09.2-epicenter-design&quot;>;the epicenter&lt;/a>; of the solution.
